# emsdk-puppeteer

This is basically the same as the image emscripten/emsdk but with the necessary debian dependencies installed for running puppeteer.

I use this image for running tests on Emscripten/WebAssembly bindings for a compiled C library, from inside a browser environment (with Puppeteer).
